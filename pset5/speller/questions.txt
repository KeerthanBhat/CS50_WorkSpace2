0.  It is the longest word in the English language published in a dictionary. 
    The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as "an artificial long word said to mean a lung disease caused by inhaling 
    very fine ash and sand dust."

1.  getrusage() returns resource usage measures for either SELF or CHILDREN or THREAD.

2.  16 members are there in a variable of type struct rusage.

3.  We pass before and after by reference (instead of by value) to calculate because they are of the data type structures and
    it is convenient to structures by their address which saves a lot of memory and time.

4.  In the main function, after checking for the correct usage of arguments and deciding the dictionary file, we load it into 
    the memory and open up the text file. In the for loop where the words are checked for misspelling, characters from the text 
    the text file are accessed one by one until EOF. These characters are checked if they are alphabets or apostrophe and stored
    in the array called word. When index exceeds length viz, 45 the remainder of that string will be passed off using while 
    loop. Same is the case when a digit is encountered. If none of these cases are true, then the word would have ended. 
    Therefore we increment the word count and check the word with dictionary words using check() function. If not found in the 
    dictionary, then the word is printed and count of mispelled words is incremented. Then index is set to 0 again to prepare 
    for the next word and the process continues.
    
5.  We have used fgetc to read each wordâ€™s characters one at a time rather than use fscanf since we want to check each character
    and deem integers and other punctuations as invalid.

6.  The parameters for check and load are loaded as const because once they are accessed in the program, they should not be 
    changed again. They should be constant throughout the function execution.
